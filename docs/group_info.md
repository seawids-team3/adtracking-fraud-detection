## Our goal
Our initial goal is to have more experience in different area of data science.  The project has been chosen because the cybersecurity getting more and more vital ever day and there are lots of demand for cyber-protection in the market. The project is also involves a large number of records. The significance of the project brings us an opportunity to experience in a big data project. 

As a result, we would like stretch out skills in handling big data, implementing a model in Spark and eventually dealing with using a cloud services like AWS, Google, Azure or similar. 
Presenting our final model in team, helps us to work on a more realistic workplace environment. We also practice our team working skills. 
We would like our mentor to:
